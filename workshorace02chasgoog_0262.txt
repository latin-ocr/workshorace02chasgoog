written probably A. U. G. 725, on the return of Augustus to Rome after the
taking of Alexandria.

that a new deluge was coming, as the Tiber, the unauthorlzed avenger of Ilia,

ceivable wrath of heaven: cf. ἐν δίνῃσι βαθείῃσιν μεγάλῃσιν. Il. 21,
239.'’ Some ears are too captious on such points. Lowell rightly
