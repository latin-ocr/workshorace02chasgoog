We desire also to direct the attention of teachers to the ad-
vantages to be gained by the use of these books over those which
give only “ as much Latin as it is necessary to read in order to

the teachers of Latin throughout the country who are using
these books, for the high position that has been accorded to
them. Grateful for the very flattering welcome they have re-
, ceived, we pledge ourselves that the subsequent volumes shall
