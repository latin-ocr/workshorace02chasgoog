Oarm. IX. —Ad Lollium. (738-742.)

Anconam—'rma not that my verses will die: though Homer stands first
among poete. Pindar. Simonides, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Anacreon, Sappho,- these
all survive. Helen was not the first woman that loved3 nor Ilium the only city
that has been sacked3 nor the heroes of the Iliad all that have l'ought; but the
rest have been sorgotten, because they have no poet to sing of them. Bnried vir·
tue is little better than buried dnlness. Ι will not, therefore, let thy labors pass

unsung, Lollium thy sagacity and uprightness, thy mind free from avarice aud
secure from corruption. It is not the possessor of riches that is wealthy, but the
man who knows how to use the gifts ot· Heaven, and to endure poverty, who hstes
corruption, and is ready to lay down his life for his country or his frlends.

1. No forto eredas, that thou shouldat not per-chance suppose. Verses
5-12 give the qrounde for not supposing that Horace’s verses will die.—
8. Horace is proud of having introduced lyric poetry among the Ro-
mans, — ’1. Geae, i. e. of Simonides of Ceos. -7. Himoes. This epi·
thet applies to the martial and revolutionary odes of Alcaeus.—
8. Graves, diynvfied.—l2. Puellae, i. e. Sapph0.—13-15. Arsit gov-
erns crines, as mirata governs the other aecusatives. Mc.—cultu8‚
state, pomp, splendor: (referring to his outward appearance, his bear-
ing, dress, ete.) —18. Non semol—vexata, not once alone was a Troy
besieged (lit. harassed, molested); (other cities have suffered as well.)
So Ο. Others, as R„ N„ Br., apply the statement to Troy exclusively:
“ More than once was Troy besieged,'' viz. by Hercules and Telamon
(Str-ab. XIII. 1, 32), and by the Amazone, as well as afterwards by the
Greeks—29. Inertiae. Poetical use of the dat. after distat, instead
of the abl. with ab. In the same way Horace always uses discrepare,
differre, dissentiret-discidere with the-dat.

85. Rerum prudens, experienced in affairs, hence sagacium in (bus-
iness or) action ,· full of worldly wisdom and knowledge of the world.—
36. Rectus, creet, implies both nubent, unmoved, and morally upriqkt.
37-89. The nouns vindex and consul (strictly appositive) are used
like adjectives to define aruimus, which itself is used where we might
have had the personal pronoun Tu es, etc. Bent. collecte many in-
stances of animus spoken of in the same way as a person 3 animm aesti-
mator, contemptor, dom-inus, rex, eto.— 41 Judox, (as) a qood and faithful
judqe ; appositive, as is vietor, to animm. -42. Alto, losty. -Νοοοιι-
tium, of the wichad—catervas, troops (of tempters). 0., N. R. takes
it of enemies in war. — 44. Harl: carried ease hin arms, victorious. Mo.—
46. occupat, claime. -δι, Non ille timidus, not searsul he, eto.
