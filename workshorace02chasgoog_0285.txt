Anconem-My beart is recalled to love, which Ι thought Ι had put away
for ever. Ι long sor Glycera, saiz-er than marble, and the mischievous sace so dan·
gerous to look upon. With all her strength hath Venus come upon me, and bids

briena aspici, i. e.‚ dangyerous to look upon, as slippery ground is dan-

shooting their arrows or thr-owing their darts at them from horsebaek.
Quae nihil attinent, thium that concern me not, things that are nothing
to a man in love. —Vivum caespitem. An altar of this sort was en-
j0ined upon the Israelites in the wilderness, in preference to any other.
The word verbena was used sor any boughs‚ herbS, or plants employed
sor crowning the altar or for sacred purposes.—Tura. The best MSS„
K„ R„ N„ and Wagner (on Vir-gil) prefer this orthography. The testi-
mony of lapidary inscriptions, however, seems to favor thura.-- Veniet,
