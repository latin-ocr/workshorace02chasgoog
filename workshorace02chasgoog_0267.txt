nouum.-·rho winter is thawing; the spring is retnrning3 the sailors are
launching their ships; the herde quit their stalls and the ploughman his firesid05
and the meadows are no longer white with frost. Venus and the Graces are
leading the dance, and the Cyclopes’ sorge is hurning. Let ns bind the head with
myrtle or the earth's first ssowers, and sacrifice a lamb or kid to Pan. Death calls
on rich and poor alike. Life is short, Ο Sestius! and our hopes we must contract.
'l'he grave awaits thee; and when there, no more shalt thou preside at feast·-

these verses from Tennyson's Locksley Hall ε -

“ In the spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin’s breastz
In the spring the wauton lapwing gete himself another crest3
In the spring a livelicr iris changes on the burnished dove:
In the spring a young man‘s fancy ligbtly turns to thoughts of love.”
