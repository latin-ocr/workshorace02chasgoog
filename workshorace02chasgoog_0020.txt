Strong and lively, the proper metro sor appeal and sucum-agemont, exhortationi
und admonition.

The first verse, beginning with a monosyllabic basis, consiste oi* two halves; the
third verse is the doubling of the first of those halves; the fourth verse is a pure
restam, combining the second halece of the two preceding kinds of verse. 'l'he
Alcaic strophe, then, is like a composition in which a musical thought, aster it
has impressed itseli' upon the ear by repetition, is resolved into its elements and
further carried out.

Horace employs this metre more than any other, and it is hence often called
the Horatian stanza. (Ι. 9, 16, 17, 26, 27, 29, 31, 34, 35, 37 ; 11. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,
14, 15, 17, 19, 20; 111. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 17, 21, 23, 26, 29ς IV. 4, 9, 14,15.)

with a prevailing tone of melancholy‚ while the falling rhythms of the shorter
verse seem to represent hopelessness and resignation. (lv. 7.)
