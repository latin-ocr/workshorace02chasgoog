JoHN S. HART, LL. D., Principal of the New

Jersey State N ormal School. Price by mail,
post-paid, 31. 50. ’
ᾗ Dr. Hart has been engaged for at least one-third of a century
’ in the practieal duties of the school-mom, and sor years past has
made a speciality of the subject of which the present volume
treats. He thus brings to his work a full knowledge of the wants
of both teacher and scholar in this important branch of educa-
tion, and he has spared no pains to make the book eminently
practical and adapted to use in tlte class-raom, The peculiar
features of the book are apparent, and, we believe, combine all
the elements of a popular and successful text-book. The author's
own style of composition, so remarkable for its rhetorical excel-
lence, gives to his work the advantage of being on every page
a model of what it teaches.

The typographical arrangement is such as to please the eye,
and, at the same time, enable the teacher to assign for memoriter
exercises, only the more important mles, definitions, etc„ leaving
the argumentative and descriptive portions to be either com-
mitted to memory, studied in some more general way, or used as
a reading or class exercise‚ as the teacher may deem most
expedient.
