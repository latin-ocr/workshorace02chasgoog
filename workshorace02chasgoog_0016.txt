to love, was the severest. wound that time could bring. ‘⁴ The
shocks of Chauce‚ the blows of Death ’' smote him heavily3 and
the failure of youth, and spirits, and health, in the inevitable
- decay of nature, saddened the thoughtful poet in his solitude‚
and tinged the gayest societ-y with melancholy. Maecenas's
health was a source of deep anxiet-y to him; and 0110 of the most
exquisite Odes (Carm. 11.-17) addressed to that valued friend, in
answer to some outburst of despondency‚ while it. expresses the
depth of the poet's regard, bears in it the tone of a man some-
what weary of the world. He declares that, if untimely fate
shall snatch away his patron, 110 will not survive him; and the
prophecy was fulfilled almost to the very let-ter. The same year
(A. υ. 0. 746, Β. 0. 8) witnessed the death of both Horace and
Maecenas. The latter “led the way‚’' (as the poet foretold), com-
mitting his friend, in almost his last words, to the care of Au-
gustus: Horati Flacci, ut mei, esto memor. On the 27111 of No-
vember. when he was on the eve of completing his fifty-seventh
year, Horace himself died, of an illness so short and sudden that
110 was unable to make his will in writing. He declared it. verb·
ally ,before witnesses‚ leaving to Augustus the little which he
possessed. He was buried 011 the Esquiline Hill, near his pat-ron
and friend Maecenas.

There are no authentic busts or medallions of Horace, and his
descriptions of himself are vague. He was short in stature, his
eyes and hair were dark, but the latter was early silvered with
gray. He suffered at one time with an affection of the eyes,
and seems to have been by no means robust in constitution. His
habits were temperate and frugal, as a rule‚ although 110 was far
from insensible to the charms of a good table and good‚wine‚
heightening and heightened by the zest of good company. But
he seems to have had neither the stomach nor the taste for ha-
bitual indulgence in the pleasures of the table. Latterly he be·

, sought at Baiae and Tibur the refreshment or shelter which his
mountain retreat had ceased to yield to his delicate frame.

Of all his writings‚ Horace himself appears to have ascribed
the greatest value to the odes, and to have rested upon them his
claims to posthumous fame. They were the result of great labour,
as he himself indicates (Carm. 1v. 2, 27 sqq.); and yet they
bear pre-eminently the charm of simplicity and ease. He was
the first to mould the Latin tongue to the Greek lyric measures3
and his success in this difficult task may be estimated from the
fact that, as he was the first. so was he the greatest, of the Ro-
man lyrists. In airy and playful grace, in happy epitheta, in
variety of imagery‚ and exquisite felicity of expression, the Odes
are still unsurpassed among the writings of any period or lan-
guage. It is these qualities and a prevailing vein of genia] and-
sobei· wisdom‚ which imbue them with a charm quite peculiar,
