This and the five following odes appear to have been written about B. C. 26,
when Augustus was anxious to effect the social reformation ot· his subjecte. The
first stanza of this Ode is generally regarded as an introduction to the whole six.

1-24. Profanum volgus, the unz'nitiated hercl, the vulgar rabble.—-
Favete linguis (εὖφημιῖνι), “be propitium] with your ton-ques: ” speak
good words, or none at all 3 here rather the latter, observe a reliqione
silence. A formula used by priests before pez-forming a religione rite.
Order: (Ego), Musarum sacerdos, canto virginibus puerisque carmina
non prius audita. [n sacerdos appears a little of Horace's conception
of the sacredness of the office of a bard, -some recognition, perhaps,
of the responsibilities wnich the gift of genius involves—Virginibus
puerisque, dat. of advantage. The moral precepts of this ode are
especially adapted for the right training of the young, in whom alone
lay Horace's hopes for better times.-— Order: (Imperium) regum timen-
dorum (est) in proprios greges (over their oum herde, i. e. subjecte).
Homer calls kings eheplaerds of the people ; a kindlier expression than
calling the people the kings' own fiocks and herda—Clari giganteo
triumpho, renowned for hie triumph over tlte yiante3 abl. of cause.—

Superoilio‚ with hie brow. A variation from the ordinary phrase, by

 

Mu nod. cf. Iliad. 1, 528; Catul. 64, 2045 Verg. Aen. 9, 106. —Est ut, e

etc. 'It happens that one man marks out the rows of his vines by
furrows drawn to greater length than another (viro), i. e. possesses wider .
domains.— One candidate (for the consulship) is of nobler birth (gene-
rosior), another superior in character ‹md reputation, another has α
greater crowd of retainers. Campum, the Campus Martius, in which
the electione were held. — Sortitur imos, determines the lot of the dia-
cinquiehed and the lowest ,· (her) capacious urn keeps every name in mo-
tion. When a man's name was shaken out of the urn, he died. (ΙΙ.
iii. 25—28.)—Destriotus ensis. An allusion to the story of Damo-
oles (see Index P. N.).- Avium. The wealthy Romans kept singing-
birds “in aviaries within their houses. Their notes, and the sound of
distant music, and the trickling of water, were among the artificial
means for soothing the nerves and inducing sleep, practised by the lux-
urious.’'—The gen. agrestium virorum limits domos. O. prefers to
take it with both somnus and domoe.— Tempe is used here for any beau-
tiful shady vale. What is its number and gender?

25—48. Quod satie est, (only) a sufficieney. -Vineae fundusque, etc„
non (sollicitant).—Mendax. deecit-ful, i. e. which disappoints his ex-
pectations.-Gulpante. Horace represents the trees or vines, when
reproached by their owner for their unfruitfulness, as throwing the
