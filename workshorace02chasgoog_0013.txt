LIFE OF HORACE.

ΒΥ THEODORE MARTIN.

(Asamum.)

UINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS was born vi. Id. Dec. A. u. c.

689 (B. c. 65), during the consulship of L. Aurelius Cotta and
L. Manlius Torquatus. His father was a freedman of the town

of Venusia, the modern Venosa‚ the inhabitants of which be· ·

longed to the Horatian tribe, and had received his manumission
before his son was born. He had realized a moderate independ-
ence in the vocation of coactor, a name borne indifferently by
the collectors of public revenue, and of money at sales by public
auction. To which of these classes he belonged is uncertain, but
most probably to the latter. With the fruits of his industry he
had purchased a small property near Venusia, upon the banks
of the Aufidus, the modern Ofanto. in the midst of the Apennines,
upon the doubtful boundaries of Lucania and Apulia. Here the
poet was born, and in this pict-uresque region of mountain, forest,
and stream the boy became imbued with the love of nature, which
distinguished him through life.

In his father's house, and in those of the Apulian peasantry
around him, Horace had opportunities of becoming familiar with
the simple virtues of the poor‚—their independence, integrity,
chastity, and homely worth, —which he loved to contrast with
the luxury and vice of imperial Rome. He appears to have been
an only child. No doubt he had at an early age given evidence
of superior powers3 and to this it may have been in some mea-
sure owing, that his father resolved to give him a higher edu-
cation than could be obtained under a provincial schoolmaster,
and, although ill able to afford the expense, took him to Rome
when about twelve years old, and gave him the best trainin g which
the capital could supply. No money was spared to enable the
boy to keep his position among his fellow-scholars of the higher
ranks. He was waited on by numerous slaves, as though he were
the heir to a considerable fortune. At the same time, he was not
allowed to feel any shame for his own order, or to aspire to a
position which he was unable to maintain. Under the stern tu-
torage of Orbilius Pupillus, a grammarian of high standing, richer
in reputation than gold, but unduly fond of the rod, he learned
grammar, and became familiar with the earlier Latin writers and
