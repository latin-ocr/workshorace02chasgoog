Annuumr.—Sing, calliope, a losty strain. Is it a dream, or am 1 wandering
in the Muses’ grove? A child, tired of play, 1 lay down to sleep on the Apulian
hills. There doves made me a covering of leaves, and 1 slept sase, and men might
well wonder how the gods were present with me. Your-s am 1, γε Muses. Be-

ease of proper names (N. cites Homer’s ’Σρές ’Χρες βρυτολοιγέ) 3 nor is
there any difficulty in the apparent inconsisteney of the propositione
in and caetra. Voltur lies ohiefly in Apulia, but partly in Lucania3 so
