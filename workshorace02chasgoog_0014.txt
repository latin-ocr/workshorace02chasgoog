with Homer. What· was of still more importance, during thi-
critical period of his first introduction to the temptations of the
capital, he euj0yed the advantage of his father's personal superin-
tendence, and of a careful moral tra'rning. His father went with
him to all his classes, and, being himself a man of shrewd obser·
vation and natural humour, he gave his son's studies a practical
bearing, by directing his attention to the sollies and vices of the
luxurious and dissolute society around him, and showing their
incompatibility with the dictates of reason and common sense.
From this admirable father Horace appears to have gathered
many of “the rugged maxims hewn from life'' with which his
works abeund. and also to have inherited that manly independ-
ence for which he was remarkable, and which, while assigning
to all ranks their due influenee and respect, never either over·
estimates or compromises its own. Under the homely exterior
of the Apulian freedman we recognize the soul of the gentleman.

At what age Horace lost his father is uncertain, but probably
before he left Rome for Athens, to complete his edueation in the
Greek literature and philosophy, under native teachers. This
he didsome time between the age of seventeen and twenty. At
Athens he found many young men of the leading Roman families,
engaged in the same pursuits with himself. He was no careless
student of the classics of Grecian literature, and, with a natural
enthusiasm, he made his first poetical essays in their flexible and
noble language. His usual good sense, however, soon caused
him to abandon the hopeless task of emulating the Greek writers
on their own ground, and he directed his efforts to transfusing
into his own language some of the grace and melody of these
masters of song. In the political lull between the battle of Phar-
salia, A. u. c. 706 (B. c. 48), and the death of Julius Caesar, A. υ. c.
710 (Β. c. 44), Horace was enabled to devote himself without in-
terruption to the tranquil pursuits of the scholar. But when,
after the latter event, Brutus came to Athens, and the patrician
youth of Rome, fired with zeal for the cause of republican liberty,
joined his standard, Horace, infected by the general enthusiasm,
accepted a military command in the army which was destined to
encounter the legions of Antonius and Octavius. His rank was
that of tribune, and his appointment excited jealousy among his
brother officere, who considered that the command of a Roman
legion should have been reserved sor men of nobler blood. But
he had manifestly a strong party of friends, who had learned to
appreciate his genius and at-tractive qualities. It is certain that
he secured the esteem of his commandere, and bore an active
part in the perils and difficulties of the campaign, which termi-
nated in7 1tge tot-al4gefeat of the republican party at Philippi,
