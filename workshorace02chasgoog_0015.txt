ΜΗ, or HoRAon. ix

in the Quaestor's office, a sort of sinecure clerkship of the Trea·
sury, which he continued to hold for many years, if not, indeed,
to the close of his life. It. was upon his return to Rome that he
⁴ made the acquaintance of Virgil and Varius, who were already
famous, and to them he was indebted sor his introduction to
Maecenas. The particulars of his first interview with his patron
he has himself recorded (Sat. 1. vi.). The acquaintance rapidly
ripened into mutual esteem. It secured the position of the poet
in society, and the generosity of the statesman placed him above
the anxieties of a literary life. Throughout the intimate inter-
course of thirty years which ensued there was no trace of con-
descension on the one hand, nor of servility on the other.

By Maecenas Horace was introduced to Octavius, probably
soon after the period just referred to. About A. υ. c. 722, Ho-
race, who had already given to the world many of his poems‚
including the ten Satires of the first book, received from Mae-
cenas the gift of the Sabine farm, which at once afforded him a
compet-enee, and all the pleasures of a country life. 'l'he sarm
was situated in the valley of Ustica. about twelve miles.from
Tibur (Tivoli)‚ and, among its other charmS. possessed the valu-
able attraction for Horace, that it was within an easy distance
of Rome. Here he spent a considerable part of every year.
Here he could entertain a stray friend from town, —his patron
MaecenaS, upon coensium—and the delights of this agreeable
retreat were doubtless more than a compensation for the plain
fare, or the thin home-grown wine, vile Sabinum, with which its
resources alone enabled him to regale them.

The life of Horace from the time of his intimacy with Mae-
cenas appears to have been one of comparative ease and of great
social enjoyment. He was soon admitted to the friendship of
Augustus, and to the close of his life his favour at court contin-
ued without a cloud. And favour did not spoil him. He was
ever the same kindly, urbane. and simple man of letters he had
originally been, never presuming upon his position, nor looking
superciliously on others less favored than himself. At all times
generous and genial, years only mellowed his wisdom and gave
a finer polish to his verse. The unaffected sincerity of his na-
ture and the rich vein of his genius made him courted by the
rich and noble. He mixed on easy ternis with the choicest soci·
ety of Rome; and what must that society have been which in-
cluded virgil, Varius, Plotius, Tibullus, Pollio, and a host of
others who were not only ripe scholare, but had borne and were
bearing a leading part in the great actions and events of that
memorable epoch?

At no time very robust, Horace's health appears to have de-
clined for some years before his death. He was doomed to see
some of his dearest friends drop into the grave before him. This
to him, who gave to friendship the ardour which other men give
