Oarm. 1.—Ad Maecenatem. (725-736.)

This introductory ode serves both as a preface to the first three books, which
were published together, and ae a dedication to Horace’s friend and patron

Maecenas.

Anemurium—Maecenas, my protector, my pride, various are the aims ot· men.
One man delights in Olympio contests, another in the bonore os the state, another
in his well-filled barne. The farmer will not plough the sees, the merchant ls
restless on land. One loves his ease and his wine, another the camp and tho din
of war, while the hnntsman braves all westhers for his sport. My glory is in the
poet’s lvy crown, my delight to retire to the groves with the nymphe and the
satyra, where my muse breathes the flute or strikee the lyre. Π thou shalt rank me
among the lyric choir, I shall list my head to the skies.

1. Maecenas. See the Index of Proper NameS.—Atavis. Abl. of
source, aster edito (from edo), a participle denoting birth. H. 425, 3,

1); A. ὼ S. 246: Β. 9183 A. 54, VIII. Atavis here is a general term
sor anceetore. What is its proper or original meaning? (See Lex.) —-
Regibus, in apposition with atavis, and kindred in force to a relative
clause (H. 363, 3), (who were) kings. Maecenas belonged to the family
of the Cilnii (an ancient and leading house at Arretium), which was
descended from Lucumonee, or princes of Etruria: (Carm. 111. 29, 1,
Set. Ι. 6, 1, 2).

2. ὃ Bt. A spondee. Interjections consisting only of a vowel (or of
a vowel followed by Ῑι), cannot be elided3 by elision the whole word
would disappear in reoitation.— The friendship of Maecenas was a pro-
tection to Horace against the assanlts of the envions and censorious,
conferred upon him many solid advantages (as the gift of the Sabine
sarm), and was an ornament and an honor to him, from the socia! pres·
tige attending an intimacy with the first gentleman of Rome.—- Notice
the allitaration in dulce decue, as in dulce et decorum, dulce· docta, dulce·
