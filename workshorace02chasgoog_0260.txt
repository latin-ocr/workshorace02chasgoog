254 Nonis,

what was called the solid day. “ Solidus signifles that which has no
vacant part or space.''

21, 22. Horace delights in pictures like this (especially atti-active
in a warm country like Italy), of taking rest under grateful shade and
by the side of murmuring &reama—Membra, acc. of specification,
with stratus (from sterno). - The arbutus (arbutus unedo, or strawberry-
tree) is a beautiful shrub, and remarkable for the bright color of its
evergreen leaves.-1.ene, sostly whispering, gently murmuring.--
caput, spring, “ well-head.'’— Sacrae, i. e.‚ to the nymphs. ‘⁴ Shrines
were usually built at the fountain-head of streams, dedicated to the
nymphs that protected them.''

23. The lituus or clar-ion was a bronze trumpet, curved at one ex·
tremity like an augur’s staff. It was sharp or shrill in tone, and was
used by the cavalry. The tuba, erumpet, was straight (as its name
denotes) and of a deep tone, aud used by the infantry.—1.ituo (abl.
governed by Ρειηιιίαιὴιεῑ)ξ licui sonitu, a brief mode of expression com-
mon in all languages. .

24. Hatribus. ‘⁴ Dat. of the agent with the passive part. detestata?
But notice that, while the abl. with a or ab denotes the agent directly
and simply, the more subtile construction with the dat. marks the action
rather as affectinq the inteream of the agent, or as standing, to him in a
certain relation .· as here, ware, to mothers α thing] abhorred, (“ war, the
detested of mothers,’' 131.) There are a few cases, however, as Ep. Ι.
19, 3, where this original distinction between the dat. and the abl. with
ab seems to have been lost sight of, as there is a natural tendency, in
all languages, to the occasional disregard of distinctions so delicate.

25. Detestata, a deponent part. used passively, as modulatus (Ι. 32,
5), metatus (ΙΙ. 15, 15), abominatus (Epod. 16, 8). “Demaratus is
nowhere else used passively‚ except by the law-writers, who use it of
one convicted by evidence.”-Sub Jove, under the open sky, as nub
divo (the latter word being derived from the same root as the Iov or
Ia which in composition with pater makes Jupiter or J uppiter3 com-
pare interdiu). Ennius: Aspice hoc sublime candens, quem invocant
onmes Jovem'. Tho Romans often use Jupiter for the heavons or their
phenomena.

27. Catulis, poetical dat. of: the agent. See note on matribus (24).
H. 3883 A. ὦ S. 225, 11.; Β. 844; A. 51, VIII. How do wo know that
catulis is not abL? (H. 414, 55 A. ἅ S. 248, 1.; B. 8783 A. 56, IV.)

28. Teretes (smooth‚ rounded), firmly twisted‚ well-wrouqht; some
translate taperiny, in allusion to the conical shape of tho nets, plagas,

neto, toils.
