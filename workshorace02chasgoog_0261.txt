ρ ODES, 1. i. ’ 255

29. Doctus (like the Greek σοφος) is an epithet of poets, musinium,
and men skilled in any art.--Hederae. The ivy was sacred to Bac-
chuS‚ by whose inspiration poets were often fired.

30. nis, dative ι join me to, place me amonq the gods.

31. The nymphe represent the sweet and graceful aspects of nature,
the satyrs the wild and grotesque. -Ῑιονοε, nimble-footed, lively.

32. Populo, abl. after a verb of separation. In the best prose, secerno
is generally followed by the prep. ab. M. 261, obs. 3 ; Z. 468 3 A. ὦ S.
251, Rem. 35 B. 916, 917; A. 54, VI. - “ The tibia” (most conveniently
tr. flute) “was a sort of flageolet. Used in the plural, as here, it has
reference to two of ‘these instrumente played by one person. Their
pitch was different, the low-pitched tibia being called ‘ dextra: because
it was held in the right hand, and the high-pitched ‘ sinistra,' because
held in the left.'' Mc.

33. Euterpe (εὖ and τέρπω, “the well-pleasing”) was said to have
invented the tibia, and she especially presided over music 3 Polyhym-
nia (πολύς and ὕμνος, “rich in song,” or the muse “ of the sublime
hymn '') invented the lyre. In tibias Euterpe, Horace alludes to his
lighter verses (as he does in me yelz'dum—populo, 30-32): in me doe·
tarum— superis (29-30) and Polyhymnia— barbiton to his lostier strains.

34. Lesboum, Lesbian ,· an allusion to Horaee's great lyric models‚ the
poets Alcaeus and Sappho, natives of the island of Lesbos. —Tondero,
to atrike (lit.‚ stretch [the stringsJ). The barbitos (-0n) was larger than
the ordinary lyre.

35. Quod si, and if. Rarely used in poetry, but found in ΙΙΙ. 1, 41 ς
Epod. 2, 39. Quod is strictly acc. of specification, in reqard to which,
i. e.‚ in regard to the matter in hand, or the general subjectos our
discourse, etc. The conjunctive quality of the relative appears iu our
translation and.— N ine of the lyric poete of Greece were recognized as
pre-eminent in merit: they were Pindar, Alcaeus, Sapph0, Stesichorus,
Ibycus, Bacchylxdes‚ Simonides, Alcman (or Alcmaeon), and Anacreon.
Inseres. This use of the fut. is modest. The poet awaits the ⁸indg-
ment of his friend.

36. A literal translat-ion gives best the force of this hyperbole. The
poet means, Ι shall feel mysolf exalted to the skies‚ 1 shall be at the

summit of my hopes.

*as* Horace’s odes can generally be divided into etr-ephes of four lines each. This
first ode, however, begins and ends with a distich, the first (1-2) containing the
address to Maecenas, the second (35-36) intimating tho completo satisfaction which
Horace will feel if his patron gives him a favorable judgment. This gracesul dedi-
cation may possibly have been an asterthotight3 its omission would leave a com·
plete ode of eight strophes (3-34), an appropriate introduction to the book.
