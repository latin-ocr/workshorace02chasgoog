epistles. In Epist. 1. ii. Horace seems to have taken the privilege of
an intimate friend of the family to write to Lollius, who was employed
in studying oratory at Rome and composing declamations. Through-
out this graceful letter, he moralizes to the young student out of Homer,
as an Englishman might out of Shakespeare, as the great storehouse
for examples of vice and virtue ιο which he might perpetually reeur.

Lucilius, G. The first writer of hexameter satire.. The few broken
fragments of his writings which remain show great force, vehemence,
and even picturesqueness of expression, but his verses are hard and
harsh; his language, though at times strongly vernacular, strains aster
Greek compounds; and we can even now, (says Milman,) if we com-
pare the idiomatic pellucidity of Horace, understand the sense of the
word muddy (lutulentus) as applied ιο the flow of the verse of Lucilius⁸

Lupus, 0. Cornelius Lentulus, consul 156 B. e. An obJeet of fieres
satire ιο Lucilius.

Μαθοὸῐιαε, G. (lunius, traced his descent from the Lucumonee of Etru-

sures. His enormous wealth, his culture, and his intimacy with the
sovereign, gave him the highest social position in the capital. Content
with this, and especially fond of his ease, he declined the highest ho-
nors of the state, and preferred to remain a simple knight. “What
did he care, whether his toga had a broad or narrow stripe of purple ἲ ”

He built upon the Esquiline hill a palaee, whence he had a prospect
ever the whole city and neighborhood of Rome, as far as Forli, Tuscu-
lum,'Palaestrina, etc„ one of the most splendid which can be conceived 3
and here, in the midst of the voluptuous garden into which he had
converted the heretofore unwholesome Esquiline hill, he was enabled
to enjoy the pleasures of the most beautiful villa. Here, after the
toils and disquiets of the civil wars, and after he had at length at-
tained the end of all his exertions, A. n. c. 727 (about the fortieth year
of his life), while he saw Augustus in quiet possession of a power and
dignity which he was conscious was his work, he abandoned himself to
his natural inclinations for quiet, pleasure, and those arts which are
the offspring and the parents of contentment. His house, his table,
