Lalage, (λαλαγή), i. e. the prattler.

Lamia, L. Aelius, of a very noble family ς a warm friend of Horace;
cos. A. u. c. 756. Horace speaks of him (Epist. 1. xiv.) as mourning
the death of his brother Quintus.

Laomedon, king of Troy, whom Neptune and Apollo, having dis-
pleased Jupiter, were condemned to serve for wages. When they had
built for him the walls of Troy, he refused to give them the reward he
had promised.

Leuconoe, perhaps a fictitious person, or perhaps the whole ode ad-
dressed to her (1. xi.) is a translation from the Greek.

Licinius Murena, 11„ called by adoption A. Terentius Varro Hu-

Ligurinus, an imaginary youth.

Lollius, m.. Palicanus (or Paullinus). It may be that Horace
knew Lollius's better qualities only, and that it was partly to console
him aster his defeat in Germany A. U. c. 738 that the Ode lv. ix. was
