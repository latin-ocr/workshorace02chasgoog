ODES IV. xiii. xiv. 343

Oarm. XIV. —Ad Augustum. (741, 742.)

ertten in honor os Tiberius, and corresponding to tlne fourth ode, which ex·
tolled the warlike deeds ot· hie younger brother Drusus.

Anconem—with what honore shall we perpetuate thy virtues, Ο mightiest
ot· princes, whose strength the insolentvindeuci have felt? with great slaughter
Drusus cast them down from their heights, and Tiberius drove them before him,
as the south wind drives the waves, or the swollcn Aufidus lays waste the corn,—
a scathless victory; and thou didst lend thine armies, thy counsels, and thine au·
apices. ’Τ was fifteen years from that day when Alexandri'a opened her gates to
thee, that For-tune brought this glor-y to thine arms. Au natione bow down to
thee, from the east to the west, from the north to the south, Ο thou guardian of
Italy and Romel

2. Plenis, adequate. —4. Titulos, inscriptions. -5, Aeternet. This
verb is found only here and in a fragment of Varro.— Qua, ae far ae.-
⁷ sqq. Quem didicere, quid posses. The more ordinary construction
would be qui quidpoeoeo, didicere. The subJect of the objectiva proposition
is here attracted into the leading] proposition as the object of the verb.

M. 439, obe. 1. The meaning, however, is somewhat fuller and more
emphatic than that which would be conveyed by the ordinary con-
struction. The Vindelici have found thee out in feeling thy prowess in
war. On the general subject of this kind of attraction (which is par-
ticularly common in the Greek poets) see my note on Cicero’s Tuae.
Βίῳ. 1. 24, 56.—9. Milite. Used as a collective noum—11. Aroes,
caotlee, sortreeeee.— 18. Plus vioe simplici, with more than a simple re-
quital, i. e. with twofold vengeance.-14. Major Neronum, the elder
of the Neron, i. e. Tiberius, afterwards emperor. —17. Connect spectan-
dus with quantia: “worthy of admiration, with what great destruc-
tion he‚’' etc„ i. e. wer-thy of admiration sor the yreat destruction with
which he, etc. Quantis = quod tantis. In spectandus we have a sim-
ilar attraction to that just illustrated in the note on line 7 3 the subJect
of the objective proposition being here drawn into the leading prop-
osition, the verb (spectandae) being in the passive voice—18. Morti
liberae, to death v'nfreedom.-— 20. Prope indomitae. R.- 22. scindente
nubes, i. e. by the showers which they cause. —24. Throuqh the midae
of the firee (of battle).—25. Tauriformis. River-gods were repre-
sented with horns, and likened to bulls on account of the strength
and violence of their waters, or on account of their roaring (μεμυκότες
ἠύτε ταῦροι. 11. xxi. 237).—-30. Ferrata, mailed. “The barbarians
wore iron breastplates.” —— 32. clade (of his own soldiers) ε majore cum
periculo quam damno Romani exercituo.
