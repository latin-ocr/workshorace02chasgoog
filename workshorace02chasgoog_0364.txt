SATIRARVM

LIBER 1.

1t was a boast of the Romans that Satire (Satira or Satura) is a kind of poetry

culiar to their nation‚ and dex-eloped independently of Grecian influences.
geomeo had as his model in this style os composition a Roman knight named
Caius Lucilius, born B. C. 148. 'she same name had already been applied to a dif-
ferent kind of poetry by Ennius (born Β. C. 239). 'l'he word itselt', derived from
sacar, (after the analogy of lanx satura, a dish filled with various kinds os fmit,)
means a medlry, miscellany, farrago, olio, olla podrida. It was applied to poeti-y
with reference to the diversity sometimes of the subjecta treated os, sometimes
of the kinds of vei-se introduced3 from the latter characteristic to the satin-es of
Ennius, from the former to those os Lucilius and Horace.

It was the object of Lucilius, in his niedleys‚ to paint the lise. the spirit, and the
manners of Rome in his day; and in the iuroads of luxury, and the gradual decay
of the ancient discipline, lie found ample occasion of ridicule and censure. Hence
his compositions often hore the character which we call satirica13 and sor a like
reason we find the same character in the similar works of Horace: yet that this
was not then considered as the essential quality of Satira appears from several of
the satit-es of llorace (e. g. 11. vii.) in which few or no truces oi· it appear. Horace's
Satires are, in the main, humorous pictures of the times and manners. 'ri-at ho
himself applied to them the name δαῆναι appears from 11.1‚ 1 and ι’, 17. ne also
calls them, together with the Epistles, Sermones, as written in uuassuming style,
in the language of familiar conversation.

Satira Ι. (716-719.)

This satire treats of the universally prevalent vice os dissatisfaction with one’s
own lot and position in lise; the eager desire of possessing more than othe-rm
and the avarice which would always accumulate, and never begin to enjoy what
has been acquired. The poet shows that men’s discontent with what they are and
with what they have, arises from their looking enviously at those before them,
instead of comparing their own advantages with the lot of men less favored than
themselves. Thus they lose all quiet enjoyment, and fill their whole lives with
the toil and restless competition of a raoe.

hemo) vivat, we take a universal subject for the affirmative clause,
(quisque) laudet. This construction is frequent in Greek and Latin,
and sometimes occurs (perhaps accidentally) in English: e. g. Sydney
Smith (cited by Y.): “ No one would laugh to sce a little child fall, and
would be shocked to see such an accident happen to an old man.''—
