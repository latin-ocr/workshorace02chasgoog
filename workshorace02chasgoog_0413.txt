De Arte Poetioa Liber. (743-746.)

With no pretence at scientific form and completeness, yet with the utmost feli-
city of transition from one subject to another, Horace deflues in this epistle some
of the primary laws of good composition. There are many verses in it which the
careful student will always remember with gratitude as among his best instruc-
tions in rhetoric.

Already in Quintilian we find this poem spoken of as liber de arte poetica ; but
Horace, always modest, could never hnve given his letter so pretentious a title.
This and the two preceding epistlvs may he classed together as kindred in style
and character, and having a common subJect.

1-23. Unity and harmony essential in composition. 2. Varias, of
var-ioue colore. Inducere, tapnim upon it (i. e. the horse‘s neck); lit.
to lay on with the painter's pencil. 3. col. membris (abl. absolute),
havinq collected the limbo from every animal. Ut, eo that.—With R„ 1
take turpiter with desinat. It is generally explained as modifying
atrum. 5. Spectatum, supine. 6. Isti. The pronoun is here used in
contempt. 7. Vanae, unreal, fantastic. 8. Fingentur. The future is
properly used asten-sore. 9. Reddatur, should be aseiyned, or should
cor-respond. Formae alludes both to the ideal in the painter’s mind, und
tho outward image which he makes· Ο. Pictoribus—potestas. The
words of a supposed objector. cf. Luc-ian .- ἦ Τ is αη old story that poete
aud painters are accountable to nobocly. Aequa, just, legitimate. 13.
Geminentur, should pair. 14. Inceptis=initim 15. Qui splendeat.
Rei. clause with subj. denoting purpose. 19 sqq. A story is told of a
Greek artist who could paint nothing well but a cypress-tree. Being
asked to paint a picture of a shipwreck‚ to be hung up as a votive
tablet‚ he inquired‚ “ You would n't like something added to the scene
in the cypress line, would you? ” 22. Rota, the (potter's) wheel. 23.
ln short, let every (poem) be at least simple and uniform. 24-31. The
want of unity (29, 30) and other saulce (25-28) often ariae from undae
ctraz‘ninq after excellences. 24,- Vatum, of us poete, (taking the pro-
noun from the termination of decipimur.) Pater et juvenes. This
epistle is said to have been addressed to L. Piso, eos. B. C. 15, who was
a friend of good letters and had been praefect of the city, and to his two
sons, the elder of whom was from seventeen to twenty years of age at
the time Horace wrote it, 28. Tutus, (reflexive,) cautious. 29. Pro·
