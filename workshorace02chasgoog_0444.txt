legeS. By JOHN GROESBECK, Consulting Ac-

In every High School and Academy in the land, the organiza-
tion of a class in Commercial Arithmetic‚ Business Calculations
1 and Forms‚ will prove an element of popularity and success that
will yield rich results. The subject itself is so intrinsically val-
uable as a means of developing thought, that, were this the only
result to be gained, it would be entitled to and should receive the

special attention of the progressive teacher. But apart from this,
the introduction os a study so interesting in itself‚ so attractive to

 

 

 

the scholar, and having so direct a bearing on his future welfare,

ff, in many an instance, decide the weisare of a school, direct-

ing the channel os popular opinion in its favor, and prove the
means of filling it with students anxious to secure its advantageS.
