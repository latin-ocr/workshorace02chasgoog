cles saw a naked sword suspended over his head by a single horse-hair
— a sight which quickly dispelled all his visions os happiness. (Carm.
111. i. 17.) .

Dellius, Q„ a man of no steady character, desultor bellorum civilium,
notorious for the shameless manner in which he changed sides in poli-
tics. He wrote a history of the campaign of Antonius against the Par-
thians, in which he had served. He had a beautiful villa, and enjoyed
the society of Caesar and Maecenas.

Demetrius, a modulator or phonascuS, a musician who gave the tone
to the actor and also to the orator 3 part of his office was to instruct the
female mimes, who recited poems, accompanying them with attitude
and gesture, both in private and in the theatre. Demetrius recited, or
taught others to recite, the poems of Calvus and Catullus. He was
called the ape, on account of his short stature and deformity.

Dossennus Fabius, a comic poet, a writer some suppose of Atellanae,
others, more justly, of palliatae and toyatae. It is curious that one
of the characters in the Atellanae was called Dossennus—a hunch-
back, half philosopher, half conjuret and diviner.

Drusus Nero, Claudius, son of Tib. Claudius Nero and Livia, and
younger brother of the emperor Tiberius ; adopted and greatly trusted
by Augustus. He gained splendid victories in Germany.

Empedocles, the famous natural philosopher of Agrigentum, wrote
all his works in verse. The story that he threw himself down the crater
of AEtna, that by his sudden disappearance he might be deemed a god,
but was betrayed by the volcano's throwing up one of his sandals, is
probably fictitious.

Enipeus, a fictitious name, coined from ἐνίπτω, το upbrm‘d.

Eutrapelus, 1². Volumnius, a Roman knight, and a boon companion
of Antonius, who received his cognomen from his wit and εὐτραπελίας
(ᾗ γᾶρ εὐτραπελία πεπαιδευμένη ὕβρις ἐστίν. Aristot. Rhet. 2, 12.)

Fannius, a bad poet, who wrote with great rapidity. He was a
parasite of Hermogenes Tigellius.

Fescennina carmina. There was a sort of rude Jesting dialogue
carried on in extempore verse at the early Latin rustic festivals, full
of good-tempered raillery and coarse humor. These were called Fes-
cennine songs, as is generally supposed from the town of Fescennia or
Fescennium, belonging to the Falisci. From these verses others, more
licentious and scurrHous, took their name, and satires got the same name,
bnt the sort of poetry with which it originated was harmIess, as Horace
says.

Flavius, the schoolmaster of Venusia·
