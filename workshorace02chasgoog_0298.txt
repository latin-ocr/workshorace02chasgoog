Oarm. 1.— Ad Asinium Pollionem. (724-727.)

Auemuxr.—The civil wars,—a danger-ons theme Is thius, and treacherons is
the ground thou treadest. Leave the tragic Muse sor a while, and thou shalt
return to her when thou hast finished the historian's task, Ο Pollio! advocate,
senator, conqueror-1 Even now 1 seem to hear the trumpet and the clarion, the
ssashing os arms, and the voices of chiefs, and the whole world subdued but tho
stubborn heart of Cato. 'l'he gods of Africa have offered his victors’ grandsons
on the toml» of Jugurtha. what land, what water-s, are not stained with our
blood? But stay, my Maso, approach not such hIgh themes.

1-8. The commotiva os the citizens which beqan in the consulship of
Metellus. Motum, and the accusatives in the next three lines, are gov-
erned by tractas. —Ex with the abl. gives the time of beginning: from
the time os. In the consulship of Metellus and AfraniuS, B. C. 60, the
first triumvirate (so called) was formed, by Caesar, Pompeius, and
Crassus3 and the origin of the civil war is traced by Horace to this
event. The war did not break out, however, till ten years afterwards.
vitia, (ite) ert-orn ,· modoS, its plans‚ measures, events.— The apori os
For-tune denotes the various vicissitude-‘1 of the struggle, and especially
the deaths of the two leaders, Caesar and Pompeius. ——Graves = exiti-
abiles, destructive. The destructive friendsht'pe os the chiestains: an
allusion to the “first triumvirate.”-Uncta, stained, polluted.— Gru·
oribus. The force of the plural seems to be with streame of blood,
“sauguine saepe et multia locis effus0.”—In writing a history of the
civil war, Pollio had undertakcu a work sall of pernam hazard, inas·
much as the passions and prejudices of the conflict had not subsided.
Opus is appositive to the whole clause Motum—tractas (omitting v. 6),
not simply to the object-accusatives.

9-16. Horace counsels Pollio to omit writing tragedias until he
shall have finished his history3 delicately flattering him by implying
that if he eeases to write, the Muse of Tragedy herself will be absent
from the theatres. —— ordinaris (= ordinaveris), thou εῘιαΖι have reduced
to order, i. e„ sbalt have described in orden—Grande munus, thy
losty malla—The cothurnus was a buckin or boot with a high sole,
worn by the aetors of tragedy, and hence used as a symbol of tragedy
itself. It is called Cecropian because tragedy arose and was perfected
in Athens, of which city Cecrops was the founder. — Rois, defendente.
