CAR-REX SAEcmssli',
Pro Incolumitate Imperi. (737.)

When Augustus had completed the period of ten years for which the imperial
power was at first placed in his hands «Β. G. 27-17), he determinet] to cele-brute his
successes at home and abroad by a revival ol· the solemn festival, which, according
to an obscure tradition, was appointed to mark the transition oi· each succe-eding
age of the republic. 'she Quindecimviri were ordered to consult the Sibyllino
books, and they reported that the time was come when this great national l'estival
(to which the name Ludi-&zeculares was now ἴοι· the first time given) should be
repeated. 'l’he ceremony was to occupy three days and nights, aud, sor some time
previous to its commencement, heralds traverscd the streete of the city and the
neigliboring towns, inviting every citizen to attend upon a solemn spectacle 201..ch
noue ο] them had ever yet seen, or could ever see ovain. Horace appears to have been
much pleased at being chosen poet-laurente of the occasion (see Carm. IV. 3, 6, 8,
and 9). 'l'he hymn was sung at the most solemn part of the festival, while the
emperor was in person offering sacrifice at the second honr of the night, on tlie
river-side, upon three altars, attended by the fifteen men who presided „wer reli·⁴
gious affairs. The chorus consisted of twenty-seven boys and twenty-seven girls
of noble birth, well trained for the occasion (Carm. IV. 6).

It is generally supposed that the hymn was sung by the boys and maidens in
the following manner:
