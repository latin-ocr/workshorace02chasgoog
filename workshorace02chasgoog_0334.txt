rosemary and brittle myrtle, to prove them with the sla-ryhter of many
sheep. Totumne, to tempt, to prove them, i. e. to try whether one ean

overtaken him, sear and death will seize him. 'l'he wandering tribes of the North
-with their free plains and toils equally shared, where stepmothers are kind and
wives are obedient and chame, and where crime meets with its reward - are hap-

recognized after death), let him put a check upon the licentiousness of the age.
Of what use is it to complain, if crime goes unpunished? Os what avail are laws

shame of poverty. If we really repent, let us give our gold to the gods, or cast
it into the sea, eradicate the seeds of avarica, and strengthen our minds with
nobler pursuits. Our youth are idle: their fathers lay up wealth by fraud: yet,
let riches increase as they will, they always fall short of men’s desires.
