288 nores,

however, both of the dat. and of the dep. part. can be seen: ‘⁶ thou who
first sang to the Lesbian citizen.’') -Ferox bello, (thou-qh) fierce in war.
Illi. The verb haereo* 18 here followed by the dat. Horace also con-
strues it with the abl. with in, and with the abl. alone. —Mihi— vo-
canti, be propitians to me whenever in due form I invoke thee.

Oarm. XXXIII. — Ad Albium Tibullum. ( 725-729.)

ARGUMENT.—Come, Albius, do not be drawling pitiful poetry upon Glycera,
because she prefers a younger man. Pretty Lycoris loves Cyrus, cyrus inclines
to Pholoe, who admires the vulgar sinner as the she-goat loves the wolf. Such
are Love's diversione, bringing opposites under her yoke together. So it hap-
pened to me‚—-a tendor heart was attached to me, while Ι could not free myself
from the setters of Myrtale.

1-16. The phrase plus nimio modifles memor. ——Gur (= quod, be-
cause), fido laesa (bersaith to thee bev‘nq broken), junior praeniteat tibi
(i. e. in her eyes).——A low forehead was considered as a. beauty, as looking
youthfu15 the abundant hair os the young hanging over their foreheads.
The women braided their hair accordingly, as is seen in some statues.
Adultero = amatore. Abl. of means, cause, or occasion3 tr. with. ——
Visum (6111),- Impares, ill-matckecl. —Melior Venus, a better passion.
Erotis -— sinus, more impetitone than the wavee of the Adriatic, indentinq
into haye the coast of Calabria.

Oarm. XXXIV. —Ad se Philosophantem.(727-731.)

In this ode, Horace shows the insufficiency of philosophy to supply the place
of a religione saith. He had held the Epicurean notion that the gods exorciso no
care over human affairs3 lut, startled by the phenornenon of thunder in a cloud·
less sky, liis beart was impressed with a sense of divine power, and he makes a
manly recantation of his erroneous belief.

1-16. Parcus, niggardly, sparing in offerings; infrequens, infrequent
in attendance on their worship.—-1nsanientis sapientiae, cm unwina
wicdom, an unphilosophical philosophy, i. e., the tenets of the Epicu-
reans. ⁴ A good instance of oxymoron.—— The pathe he had left, to which
Horace is forced to return, are those of the simple saith of his child-
hood‚ taught him by his pious father. —Diespiter2Jupiter. “The
Latin Ju and Jovi, the Gr. Ζεύς, the Sanskrit Dyaue or Dyu (meaning
both sky and day) point to a common root, signifving briyht. These
derivatives form a natural first term to express the idea of God—*the
Author of Hyla, the, Lord of heaven. In the Vedae the combination
Dyampitar (a‘Sky Father') is as frequent as Jupiter in Latin.’.’
