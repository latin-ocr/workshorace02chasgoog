by K„ Y„ and others. Three objections are urged against the tea-em
receptus ; the quantity of Apulicum, (a very weak objection, consid-
ering the liberties taken by the poets with the quantities of proper
names ς) the general use of Apulus (and not Apulicns) as the adj.; and
the fact that the eastern shore of Italy was not resorted to for summer
residence 3 which last is thus answered by Mc. : ‘⁶ This [allusion] applies
to the bay on which Tarentum is situatcd, and there the Romans had
handsome villas.'' Terrenum and publicum have to my ear something
strange 3 and, like 0., Mc„ N„ Ι think it safest to retain the old reading.
tigit. Last syl. considered as long in arsis and by the caesura.—
Summis verticibus, in the summit of thy roose (ἂετώματα), in token of
her power over thee and of her unalterable decrees.—N'ee-—annua,
i. e. nor does it please them to till the soil longer than a year. cf.
Caesar's account of the Suevi, B. G. IV. 1. —Befunctum vicarius, ancl
him who has discharqed hio labor, α substitute, upon equal terme, relievea.
Aequali sorte, abl. of description, characteristic. — Temperat with
dat„ is kind—Adultera, abl. of person in whom she does not trust.—
Et—eastitas, and fast-bound ⁹(certo foedere) chasffly, shrinking] from
any other man (than the husband).— Nefas, a crime against heaven ε if
this consideration fails to detor any one from crime, the law of the land
punishes him with death.-— Pater urbium more than pater patriae, and
nearly the same as pater urbis et orbis. N. — Quatenus, since. — Invidi.
Envy makes men disparage others while they live, and disparage their
survivors, by contrast, after their death.

33-64. Querimoniae‚ sc. proficiunt. — Boreae, dat.—- In capitolium,
i. e. to the temple of Jupiter. —Lapidee in connection with gemmae
often means peada—Inutile, litotes—Bene, i. e. sineerely.—In-
genuus, well-born.— The adj. Graecus is used with some contempt, in
the same manner as the English and Germans often speak of Frena-lt
ways. Cf. Cic. Tuac. I. 35: ineptum sane neyotium et Graeculum.— The
trochus was a circle of brass or iron, frequently set round with rings
or small bens„ and driven like the modern hoop.—Seu malis, or, ff
thou prefata—consortem socium, hie partner in busines⁸.·— Scilicet,
it is very true. —Improbae‚ monstrous3 suggesting a mingled idea of
vast or measurelew and wicked or flaqitious. Improbus is a very fre-
quent epithet in the poets of anything immoderate or excessivo. It is
often a severe tax on one’s English to translate it adequately.—Tamen
-rei. still Ι know not what little sum (i. e. some little eum or otker,
je ne sais quoi) is always wantiny. I follow N. and R. in taking
curtae rei as gen.-limiting nescio quid. Many scholare take it aa
dat.
