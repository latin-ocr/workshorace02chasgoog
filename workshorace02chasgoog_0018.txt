THE METRES OF HORACE.
(AFTER NAUCK.)

ΙΝ the Satires and Emeum, Horace uses the dactylic hexameter: yet, ln the
Satires, hie Aluna palemis purpoeely assumes a careless and easy tone. “The
approach to prose in liorace’s verse is seen, sor instance, in hle freedom with ro-
gard to ousion, particularly that of the monosyllablc particlee mm, dum, cum, ei,

which ie contrary to the epic magen in some cases of synaeresis, ae prad, quad,

vindemffitem in syncopen, ae caldior, soldum5 and contractione, as divisse, sur-
rexe. In the construction of the verso, also, we observo nn intentional accumu-
latinu of spondeos, whereas the well-framed epic line delights ue by a taeterul
variety of dactylas and spondeas.”

In the 011oe and Epodes eighteen meu-ee or symma of verse aro recognized, a.
list of which here follows. Fut-ther details may be obtained from any ot tho

Grammurs.

1. The minm- Asclepiadem system, each stanza consisting of four minor Ascle-

piade'an verses:

There is something noble in tho effect of the chon-lambe, und the ποιᾶς mat-eh
of the verse expresses calm assur-anco. Horace luas need this metro thr-leo, when
he speaks with losty inspiration of tho dignity of poetry aud his own calling aa ι
ban-d. (Ι. 1; 111. 303 IV. 8.)
