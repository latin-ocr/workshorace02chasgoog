onns 111. iii. 315

Ilium and Rome, let the exiles reign where they will ς but let tho tomb of Prism
and of Paris be the lair of beasts. From Gades to the Nile let Rome be remed, but
let her learn to despise gold. Let her stretch her arms to the stormy North und
the fiery East, but let her not dare to rebuild the walls of Troy. On un evil day
would she rise again: thrice let her rise, thrice should she fall bytho power of
Jove’s sister and sponse.” But hold, my Mune, nor bring down such themes to
