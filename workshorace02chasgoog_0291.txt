M. 247, obs. 3 3 Ζ. 469. Wine and lv‘qhts indicate a nocturnal banquet.
Aenianes, a short dayqer, worn at the side. —Immano quantum, this
phrase (lit. it is monstrous how much) is used parenthetically, and has
the force of an adverb, how vaetly. Were it the leading clause, we should
have the subj. discrepet instead of the indic. — Remanete, remain quiet
(re).-Gubito presso. The ancients reclined on couches, at table,
resting on the left elbow.

9-24. voltis =vult1‘o.—— Severi. Pliny names three kinds of the
Falernian, the austerum (which Horace here calls severum), rough and
dry, the dulce, sweet, and the tenue, thiu. Falernian became fit for
drinking in ten years, and might be used when twenty years old, or older,
if of a good vintage.—Dicat, etc. (Thea) let the brother os Meye'lla,

tant? , Dost thou hesitate?——Laborabas. The imperfect is used here
of an aetion already begun, but not until now apparent. In Greek,
ἆρ’ braum. R. The tense refers to the time when Horace asked him
the name of his sweetheart, and he was hesitating to tell; or to all
that time in which he was the slave of that passion, without the knowl-
edge of his friend. 0. - Pegasus briefly for Bellerophon with Pegasus.
Chimaera limite both illigatum and expediet.

Oarm. XXVIII.—Archytas. (717, 718.)

Among the various opinions as to tbe form and divisione of this ode, the sim·
plest and most satisfactory is that which assigna the whole to oue speaker‚— the
spirit of a shipwrecked man, moralizing upon death and asking for bur-iai. He
first addresses Archytas, noar whose tomb the scene is laidz and he joins with him
other worthies, whose wisdom and greatness had not saved them from the com-
mon lot. Then, seeing a seasaring man pass by, he calls upon him to cast dust
upon his unhuried body, in order that he may have rest.

Horace’s own nari-ow escape from death by shipwreck (111. 4, 27) may have sug-
gested to him this subject.

1-16. To is emphatic, from its position: (Even) thee—Parva mu-
nera exigui pulveris cohibent, confine, cover (in thy grave).— Temp-
ffisse‚ to have explored ,· percurrisse, to have traversed.—-Morituro
