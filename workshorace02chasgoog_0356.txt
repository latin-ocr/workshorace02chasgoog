Oarm. V. - In Canidiam. (714-720.)

'l'here is much likeness between this singular Ode and part of the eighth Satira
of the first book. A scene is represented in which Canidiae. is the chief actress.
She is passionateiy in love with oue Varus, whom she calls an old sinuer, but whose
beart she is resolved ιο win. 'ro this end she reeorts to magical philters, for the
composition os which, in company with three other witches. Sagana, Velia, and
Folia, she gnte u boy of good family, strips him naked. and bui-ies him up to his
chin in a nole, in order that there, with foed put before him, he might wither
away in the midst os longing, and so his liver might form, in conjunctiora with
other ingrediente, a love-potion, to be administered to the suithless Varus. What
could have put such a scene into Horace’s head, it is hard to say.

Canidia. is one of the few names of willch we may be sure that it represents a
real person. The scholiasts say that her real name was Grandia, anfi that she was
a Neapolitani seller ot persumes.
