PREFAOE.

 

THE editor has founded his text of Horace upon the best

manuscriptS,— as cited by Keller, Ritter, Orelli, and other

notes of Orelli, the often acute annotations of Ritter, Nauck's
sprightly commentary on the Odes‚ and Kriiger’s full and
accurate notes on the Satires and Epistles. Of recent Eng-
