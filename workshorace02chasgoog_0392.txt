EPISTVLARVM

LIBER 1.

Horace's Epistles are the work of his mature years, when all his powers were
neveloped. his knowledge or the world complete, aud his taste ripe and mellow.
lience they are, by universal contession,his most perfect compositione. Critics
unite iu eulogizing their ‘⁶ exquisite urbanity,” their ‘⁸ calm .nd commanding good
sense‚” their ⁶⁶ extraordinary and undefinable charnis.” They have all the grace
or the most animated and refined conversation. ⁸· They arc the Sloectator of the
Roman supper-tames. Shrewd sense is relieve-d by seasonable aiiecdote; a general
rnle of life by it* pun-tinent applicatiom the wisdom of age and the millies ot· youth
are reconciled; and th⁴⁴ individua} interest is extended and elevated by its connec-
tion with the minnere of thu, time and with the universal instincte ol polite society in
all ages. As miniatum-naimone ot· the humours and foiblee of mankind, Addison,
Fontaffie, and clx-:ries humb alone approach the enricus felicity of Horace.”

The poet himself style-(l liis Epistles as well as his Satires Sermones, in allusion
to the unpretemling conversatione} tone in which he wrote. The greater persec—
tion of their metre, and their finished style, however, remove them farther than
the Satires from the domuin os the Musa pedestris. Their personal and subjective
character gives a peculiar charin to these “ripeet fruite’' of a genius “alike in-
structed by Life and Art.''

Epist. 1.—Ad Maecenatem. (734.)

Some time nster Horace had published his three books cs Odes, and had, as it
appears. laid aeide that sort of writing, it seems that Maecenas. and probably his
other friends, begged him to return to it. 'snat ie the obvious meaning of the
remonstrance with which the Epistle opens. Iloracc expresses an earnest wish
to retire into privacy, to abandon poeti-y, and to devote himself to the study of
philosophy and virtue, which he recommends as the only true wisdom.
