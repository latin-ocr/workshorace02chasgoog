might be destroyed hy wild beasts. -Peleus was saved, however, by the
intervention of Chiron or Hermes.

habita, a certain Cordus (or Codrus, Verg. Ecl. vn. 26), a man of
Moorish birth, who aspircd to the same of letters, and endeavoring to
equal Timagenes in the force of his declamation, burst some of the ves-
sels of his diaphragm, and died. He perhaps had taken the name of
Iarbita to affect a descent from the Mauretaniam kings3 or the wits of
Rome had given him that name.

Iccius (unknown except from Carm. 1. xxix. and Epist. 1. xii.) had
devoted himself to philosophy and letters, but when the invasion of
Arabia under Aelius Gallus took place, was seized with a sudden access
of military ardor and the hope of enriching himself with the spoils of

The Greeks having bribed Polymestor to murder Polydorus, in his

the shade of Deiphilus appears to his mother in her sleep, and beseeehes
her to bury him.

Laberius, Decimus, a Roman knight, and a distinguished writer of
mimes. When he was sixty years old, Julius Caesar in effect compelled
him to appear upon the stage, although the oecupation of an actor was
considered as disgraeeful to a gentleman. He took, however, his re·
