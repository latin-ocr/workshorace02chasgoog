would not commit. No one can provide against all dangers. The aanor feam the
sea, and nothing else3 the soldier {ears his enemy alone; but death comes osten
from an unexpected source. How nearly was 1 sent to the regions below, where
all the silades wonder, Cerberus listune, the Furies arecha-med, and the damned
suspend their labore, while Sappho and Alcaeus sing!

On the Kalends os March, probably 724, Horace narrowly escaped death by the
fall of a trec on his Sabine sarm: the occasion of this ode. The poet pasees with
great skill from a merely personui incident to general reflectione, and a beautiful
picture ot· the honor in which bards are beldin the lower world.

1-16. Order: Ille et posuit te nefasto die, quicumque primum (te
posuit), et produxit (te) sacrilega manu, etc. Posuit, planted.— nefasto
die, on an evil day. See Lex. sor the strict meaning of the phrase.--—
In (3) with the accusative of the destined ench—Pagi, i. e. Mandela.
Et (5), even. Crediderim, I would believe. Subj. os willingness, read-
iness. (Or, I could believe.) There is an implied condition: if I were
told so.— Fregisse cervicem, i. e. strangled.— Penetralia—hospitis.
The poet heaps up all the circumstances which could aggravato the crime
of which he is ready to believe the plantei- of the tree guilty. He not
only nam-ders, but he murders hie quest, protected by the sacred laws of
hospitality; αε his very hearth-etone (penetralia), under the images of tho
household gods ; and steaIthin, v‘n the niqht. —Venena Colcha, an allu-
sion to Medea—Venena and nefas are both governed by tractavit.

takes precaution enough, in regard to what he should avoid, srom honr

Phoenicians, were largely engaged in commerce.—N eque timet caeca
fata aliunde (from any other source) ultra (beyond). — The last syl. of
timetis held as long by caesura and arsis. This liberty is the more
easily taken as the e is originally long, and only shortened by the sharp
t. R. ad loc. et 1. 3, 36. See Ritschl, Proleq. in Plaut. pp. 182 sqq.
Although the vowel had ceased to be long in the popular pronunci-
ation‚ yet Horace would find it occasionally long in the older poets,
particularly Ennius. (Corssen Krit. Beitr. 562.) .

17-38. Miles, sc. Romanus or Italuu. Supply perhorrenda—“The
soldier dreads the swift ssight of the Parthian‚” because⁸ the Parthians
were in the habit of seiqniny ssight, and then turning around unex-
pectedly to discharge their arrows upon their unsuspecting pul-euers.—
The Parthian (seara) chains arad an Italian prison. (0.‚ R„ N.) Robur
is taken by some commentator-s (D., Ob„ Me.) as meaning strength,
couraqe, “ hearts of-oak.” But the term rob-ur was often applied to
the Tullianum of Servius (Sallust. Cat. 55), the celebrated dungeon at
Rome; and as fliqht aad arv-owe complete one idea, so chaine andprieon.
