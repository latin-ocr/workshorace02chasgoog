vi PREFACE.

differs from that ordinarily used, the student will find the
more common form among the various readings, particularly
in the first part of the book. In the latter part of the book,
readings are given illustrating the most important peculiari-
ties of orthography not adopted in the text. These variations
in orthography, as well as the more important various read-
ings indicating actual differences in exproesion, are all derived
from the manuscripts (older or more recent,) unless indicated
as conjectural.

The dates at which Horace's poems were written are in
some instances easily ascertained, in others will always re-
main matters of doubtful conjecture. In disputed casea, the
two extremes of the dates which have been proposed by
scholare, or at least of the most plausible oneS, are given in
the noteS, directly after the caption of each poem.

Students of Horace will aid themselves in understanding
and appreciating him by judicious collateral reading,—espe-
cially in Roman history, where Mommsen and Merivale are
particularly recommended to their attention. But nothing
can supersede the fond and constant reading of the author
himself, continued until his own words speak directly to the

mind and ear with a power and beauty unattainable by the
best translation.
