LIFE 01³· HORACB. XI

and have given them a hold upon the minds of educated men
which no change of taste has shaken.

Horace’s Satires and Epi-siles are perhaps intrinsically more
valuable than his lyric poetry. As reflecting “the age and body
of the time‚’' they possess the highest historical value. Through
them the modern scholar is able to form a clearer idea, in all
probability, of the state of society in Rome in the Augustan age,
than of any other phase of social development in the history of
nations. Horace's observation of character is subtle and exact,
his knowledge of the hear-t is profound, his power of graphic
delineation great. A genial humour plays over his verses. and a
kindly wisdom dignifies them. As a living and brilliant com-
mentary on life, as a storehouse of maxims of practical wisdom,
couched in language the most apt and concise, as a picture of
men and manners, which will be always fresh and always true,
because it was true once, and because human nature will always
reproduce itself under analogous circumstances, his Satires. and
still more his Epi-sdes, will have a permanent value sor t'nankin

In these, as in his Odes, he inculcates what is fitting and deneg„

oue, and tends most to tranquillity of mind and body. To live
at peace with the world, to shun the extremes of avarice, luxury,
and ambition‚ to outrage none of the laws of nature, to enjoy
life wisely, and not to load it with the cares which the lapse of a
few brief years will demonstrate to be foolishness‚ is very nearly
the sum of his philosophy. of religion, as we understand it, he
had little. In common with the more vigorous intellects of the
time, he had outgrown the effete creed of his countrynien. He
was content to use it for poetical purposeS‚ but he could not ac-
cept- os matter of belief the mythology about which the forms
· of the contemporary worship still clustered.

Horace has always been a favorite with the young3 but it is
only by minds matut-ed by experience and reflection that lie can
be thoi-oughly appreciated. To them the depth of his observa-
tion and the reach of his good sense are made daily more appa-
rent; and the verses which char-med their fancy or delighted
their ear in youth, become the counsellors of their manhood, or
the mirror which focalizes for their old age the gathered wisdom
of a lifet-ime. No writer is so often quoted, and simply because
the thoughts of none are more pertinent to men’s “business and
bosoms’' in the concerns of everyday life. amid the jostle of a
crowded and artificial state of society; and because the glimpses
of nature, in which his writings abound, come with the fresh-
ness of truth‚ alike to the jaded dwcller in citios», and to those
who can test them day by day in the presence of nature herself.
