comites, (as) companium.—- (14.) There is a general concurrence of the
most Judicious editors in giving the reading Gyan but Ι am half in-

17-32. Whatever the constellation under which I was born, whether
Libra, Scorpio, or Capricornus, my star coincides with that os Maecenas,
for our foi-tunes are one. —Aspicit, i. e. as the ruling star of my horo-
scope: “presides over my fate.’' — Pars violentior, ces the more potent
parc (constellation) of my nativity (or horoscope ; i. e. of the hcavcnly
bodies in the ascendant at my birth ).— Capricornus is called the ruler-
ofthe western wave, because its rising and setting were usually attended
with stoi-ms in the Mediterraneum. -— “ In astrology Libra, Jupiter,
Venus, and Luna were deemed favor-able, while Scorpios, Capricornus,
Saturnus, and Mars were regarded as inauspicious.” — Nostrum, gen.

Mmenas and Horace in wealth. Each is to show his gratitudo to the
gods by offerings proportioned to his means.

ΔΜσΜΕΝτ.-Νο gold in my roos, no marble in my hall, no palace have Ι, nor
female clieuts to serve me; but 1 have honesty and unda-standing, and, though 1
be poor, 1 am courted by the rich: what more should Ι ask of the gods or my
friend, content with my single Sabine estate? Days are passing on. and, though
ready to drop into thy grave, thou art building and stretching thy borders, und
