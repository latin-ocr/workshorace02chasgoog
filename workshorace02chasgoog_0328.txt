vomis, streame, and hell’s bloody sentinel, and Ixion, and Tityos, and the daughters
of Danaus. Let Lyde hear os their crime and punishment, and how one was mer-
eisul and spat-ed her young husband’s lise, saying‚ ‘⁶ Rise up; begone‚ lest the sleep
of death overtake thee. They have sprung upon their prey. My beart is not as
their beart. 1 will do thee no barm. Let my father do with me as he will, yet
go thou, while night and love promet thee. Far-ewell, and when 1 am gone, eu·
grave a word of sorrow on my tomb.’'

1-29. 'l'e magistro, abl. absolute. — Nervis. abl.— Immanis janitor
aulae, the fier-ce parter os the palaea. Ο. takes immanis with aulae,
“vast.''—Furiale‚ jury-like. —19. lauet, from manare.—Quin et,
Nay even. — Risit. The poets are fond of using a. verb in the sinyular

virginum, i. e. the Danaides.— Inane like its opposite plenus is limited
by the gen. —Pereuntis, running through, runniny out. — Sub Orco, in

30-52. Nam—majus, for what yreater (crime) could they (have com-
mitted) ,ἲ -31, Poimen, they had the beart, they could briny themselves.
Una, i. e. Hypermnestra. —Faoe nuptiali, of the meptial coreb, as we
should say of the bridal veil. At ancient marriages the bride, escorted
in the evening from her father’s house to that of her husband, was pre-
ceded by a boy bearing a lighted toreh.-Splendide mendax, may-
mficently false. A noble oxymoron. Danaus had compelled all his
daughters to promise that they would murder their husband& Hy—
permnestra's breaeh of her engagement is praiseworthy, because a
wieked promise is better broken than kept.-—Falle‚ elude, escape.-

work, forlove of Hebrus, so beautiful as he bathen in the waters of Tiber, a horse·

. man like Bellerophon, unsurpassed in the eombat and the rece, in piet-cing the

flying deer or catching the lurking boar.

Up on the whole, 1 prefer to take this ode, with many recent editors, ns a solil-
oquy. R. takes verses 5-16 as Neobule' s quotation of her uncle’ s taunts3 it is not
unusual, however, to use the second person in an address to one' s sels. s’omo eon-
sider the whole ode as the address of the poet to Neobule.
