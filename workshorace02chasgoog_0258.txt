dique, desine dulcium, dulci distinet α domo, Dauniae defende decus, etc„

in subsequent odes. —- Con. “ The shield at once and glory of my life.'’
3. curriculo (from curro as vehiculum from veho) = curru, “ with the

car.’' A few commentatore give the other possible translation, in the
racc-course.— Olympicum. N. suggests that the allusion here is not
to the Grecian games, but to the imitatione ofthem at Rome, instituted
by Augustus. (See Suet. Oct. 45.)

4, 5. collegisse. The tense need give us no trouble, for a literal trans-
lation of itis perfectly intelligible in English. The remembrance of
the race is pleasant, as well as the race itself; and even during the racc,
the (lust Ῑιαε been raised, before it is thought of. But Horace chose this
form without any very subtile consideration of the sense, from the exi-
gencies of his metre, which would not admit colliyere. Notice the exact
force of colleqisse,—the yatherinq toyether or collectiny the scattered
atoms of dust into a cloud, as by a whirlwind. Cf. Sat. I. 4, 31.—
Juvat. After eunt qui the subj. is ordinarily found. By the use of the
indicative here, the poet represents the action as particular rather than
qeneral, and hence with more liveliness and definiteneee, as if he had
the very persons in his mind who are pleased by such contests. Sunt
quos is here equivalent to nonnullos, (as eet qui (v. 19)=nomzemo, eunt
quibus (Ι. 7, 5)7—-nonvzullin). Hence the construction is continued by
hunc (7) and illum (9): sc. juvat. The indic. cannot be used after ney-
ative expressions, such as nemo est qui. —Heta. At each extremity of
the spina (a low wall running lengthways down the centre of the race-
course), were three conical pillars of wood, called metam—the yoal.
“ It was the mark of a skilful driver to turn the go-al as closely as pos-
sible, which is implied in fervidis evitata roti0.'' —Fervidis‚ qlotm'n9.-
Palma. A palm-branch was given to the victors in the Grecian games,
to be borne in the hand, in addition to the garland of olive, laurcl‚ pine,
or parsley (and sometimes of palm), for the head.

6. Terrarum dominos, in apposition with deos. Cf. Ovid. Pom. I.
9, 36: Terrarum dominos quam colis ipse deos. Τ. dom.xis wrongly
taken by D. and R. as the object of evehit. —- Evehit ad deofl, transporta
to the yods ,· i. e., makes them, applauded and proud, feel themselves
great as the gods. - Notice how lively a picture Horace has given ns
by a few simple touches,—the chariot, the cloud of dust, the skilful
turning of the goal, and the palm-branch given to the proud victor.

7. Hunc. sc. juvat. G. H„ J ., and Ob. supply here evehit ad deos as
. well as juvat.—-Mobilium, fickle. cf, ventosae plebis, Epp. Ι. 19, 37.

8. Honoribus, abl. of means (the Latin idiom being “ raise with
honore ’' where we should say to honora). The threefold honore are the
