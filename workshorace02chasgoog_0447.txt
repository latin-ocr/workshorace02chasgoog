ι SON, Prof. of Mathematics in the Philadelphia
Central High School.

Ι The work is the result of an effort to produce an Elementary

ς Algebra suited to the wants of classes beginning the study. It
has been prepared by one who for years has felt the need of just
such a book, and is the fruit of long experience in the school-
room. An effort has been made to specially adapt the work to
those teachers who are not satisfied with anything less than an
ability on the part of their pupils to explain fully every opera·
tion which they perform.
