Great care has been taken to consult the authorized editions
of the various writers represented, that the extracts from their
works may be relied upon as accurate; though, in some instanceS,
preference has been given to an early edition, when, in later
issues, the alterations have not been deemed improvements.
Many poems have been introduced which have never before
found their way into any book of selections, being now for the ι
first time published in this country in a permanent form. 1

It is believed that this book will be found admirably adapted
sor use as a “ Reader,’' either in connection with any of the regu-
lar series of reading books, or to be taken up by classes that,
having used the higher readers of the different series, need variety
as an incentive to interest. For this purpose we particularly
commend it to the attention of Principals of AcademieS, Semi-

naries, High Schools‚ Normal Schools, and Institutions for Young
LadieS. '
