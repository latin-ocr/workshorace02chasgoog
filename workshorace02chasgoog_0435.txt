born probably A. u. c. 672, five years after Catullus, six years before

Asinius Pollio, twelve before Virgil, and seventeen before Ilorace: of
all these poets the intimate friend. He was ono of those who saved the

Aeneid from the flames and assisted in correcting it. Of his poem on ’

the death of Julius Caesar some lines survive, all pure and spirited,
some of masculine beauty 3 of his panegyric on Augustus two lines are
supposed to be quoted by Horace, Epist. 1. xvi. 27, 28. Quintilian de-
clared that his tragedy of Thyestes might stand a comparison with any
production of the Grecian stage.

Varro, P. Terentius Atacinus, so called from the river Atax in Gallia
Narbonensis, his native provincc; a translator of respectable talents,
and a not very successful writer of satircs and other poems.

Varus. See Quintilius. Horace speaks of another Varus as the
faithless lover of Canidia.

Veianius, a famous gladiator, wh0‚ after many battles, obtained
leave to retire from the arena, and consecrated his arms to Hercules.

Viscus, one of the two sons of Vibius Viscus, of the equestrian
order, both of whom are said to have been poets.

Voltur (Vultur), tho modern Volture, a picturesquc mountain between
Lucania and Apulia, near Horace's birth-place.

Xanthias Phoceus, (Phoceus dissyllable) i. e. youth with auburn
locks (ξανθός) from Phocis,—the addition of his birth-place giving a
certain formality and dignity to the address. The name is either in-
vented by Horace, or adopted from a Greek ode. Many of Horace’s
love-poenis are “merely a Roman' artist’s translations or paraphrases
from the Greek originals.”

Zethus and Amphion, twin-sons of Zeus (Jupiter) and Antiope,
mythic founders of Thebes· To reconcilo conflicting pretensions, Pau-
sanias supposes that Cadmus was the original settler os the hill of the
Cadmeia, while Amphion and Zethus cxtcndecl the settlement to the
lower city. Zethus despised music, holding itin suspicion as conducing

to effeminacy and vicious sloth, and bade Amphion throw his lyrc away.
There is a fine contrast in the legendary characters of the two brothers,

“the rude and unpolished, but energetic, Zethus, and the refined and
amiable, but dreamy, Amphion.” (See Grotc, Hiot. of Greece, 1. xiv.)
